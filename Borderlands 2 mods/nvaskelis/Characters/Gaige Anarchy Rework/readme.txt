The goal of this mod is to make stacking anarchy much faster so you can focus on playing the game and killing things instead of reloading in a corner for 10 minutes.
Other mods try to solve this by giving all the stacks through Rational Anarchist, but what's the point of stacks by that point?

This mod attempts to resolve this by reducing the number of max stacks by 5x and multiplying all anarchy effects by 5x: same overall power, faster acquisition.
This also means related anarchy effects, such as Discord and With Claws, are much stronger now because their cost of stacks is much more expensive with fewer overall stacks.
However, with how much damage you are now losing when using them, they seemed balanced while testing (again, same overall power).

Everything in the mod is sectioned off by skill if you want to make your own adjustments.

If you want to use UCP along with this, make sure to disable the With Claws changes. I integrated the With Claws changes from UCP and multiplied the effects because I also like running UCP (obviously, credit tothe  UCP team for those changes). 
I didn't touch the added healing UCP gave to this skill, but the damage and swap speed are scaled to the new values (didn't need more healing when testing).

With this mod, you can now enjoy gaining anarchy stacks naturally by playing the game and killing things, while also saving time when you do want to pre-stack.
